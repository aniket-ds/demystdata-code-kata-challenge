# DemystData Code-Kata Challenge Solution

> Problem 1 Solution

This pipeline is designed to parse fixed-width files and convert them into CSV format using a Dockerized Python environment. The project includes Docker support and Docker Compose for easy setup and execution.

## Prerequisites
Before running the pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup and Execution

Follow these steps to build and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aniket-ds/demystdata-code-kata-challenge.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Root Directory**
    ```bash 
    cd demystdata-code-kata-challenge
    ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose up --build
    ```
> This command will start the service defined in docker-compose.yaml, which runs the Python script main.py located in the src directory. The script will process the fixed-width file and generate a `CSV` file.

4. **Check the Output**
    ```bash
    ls data/
    ```
> You should see the `output.csv` file generated by the process.

5. **Testing**
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose run --rm demystdata-code-kata-challenge pytest
    ```
> This command will run the unit tests defined in the `tests` directory

6. **Stopping the Container**
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose down
    ```
